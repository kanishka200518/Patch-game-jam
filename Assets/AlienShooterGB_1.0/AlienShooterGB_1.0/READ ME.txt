==========================================================================

Hello! Thanks a lot for downloading my pack!

In this pack, you will find a full sprite sheet with all the assets.

Or, if you prefer, all sprites in a folder already separated for you.

==========================================================================

Info for the pack:


In the sprite sheet and on the itch page, VFX are associated with aliens as examples, but you can do whatever you want with them—feel free to experiment!


Info for the full page sprite sheet:

Each asset is inside a frame (inside the frame there is a 1px border, so be sure to select with that 1px border in mind).

Above each frame, you can find the dimensions of each asset.

For animated assets, there is NO space between frames; you can select the whole strip and cut it in your engine (the dimension shown above the frame corresponds to one frame).

In the Aseprite file, you can find a layer called "guidelines" that helps you clearly see what to select and how animations are divided.


I'm still a beginner with this and very open to criticism. If you have any questions or suggestions, be sure to comment under the itch.io asset page! (linked above)

Making sure the pack pleases everyone as best as I can is very important to me.


Info for the separated assets:

If you are not using GameMaker Studio 2, don't worry about the "_stripX" suffix after the name of an animated sprite. It is a feature in GMS that lets GameMaker split the animation automatically for you, with X being the number of frames in the animation.
